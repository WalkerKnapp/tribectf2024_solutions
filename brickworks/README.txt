I manually made modded_body.txt from challenge.txt, and then ran it through a simple python file to get modded_body2.txt
I then used this, and copied it into brick.tsp, which I wrote with brick.par. I then plugged it into LKH, and got brick.txt. I then used decode.py to get it to a string, and then reversed it using an online tool.
