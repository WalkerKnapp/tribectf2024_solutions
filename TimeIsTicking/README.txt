So, I realized the program worked by randomly (50/50 odds) either giving a hash, or random noise.
To win, you need to determnie the correct answer 10 times in a row.
As it's 50/50, I just manually brute forced it by sitting in front of the terminal, as I thought it would take longer to implement.

The intended way was by a timing attack, as I later found out, but I think the way I did it was silly :)
