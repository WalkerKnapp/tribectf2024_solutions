# Birb!

Ahoy! You stumbled across a mysterious zip file that contains a python script(`birb.py`), a directory of `birbs`, and a single bmp file called `e2f4c680.bmp`.

When you examined the python script, you noticed that it does some sketchy, piratey things to hide a custom, user inputted message by modifying the contents of the bmp file in the `birbs` folder and generating a bmp file (`e2f4c680.bmp`).

Your task, is to retrieve the message from the generated bmp file, and submit the message as the flag.
