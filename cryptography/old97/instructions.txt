Old 97

Yet another secret society on campus is trying to send an important,
encrypted message.  Once of the members, "Alice", is trying to send
an urgent message to "Bob" using the textbook Elgamal encryption
system over the group Z^*_{97}.  In other words, the group elements
are the integers 1 through 96, and the group operation is
multiplication modulo 97.  Alice and Bob decide to use 5 as the
group's generator, and Bob's public key is 61.

Alice encrypts each character of the message separately to Bob.  The
cryptosystem can only encrypt ASCII values 31 through 126, with ASCII
31 mapped to group element 1, ASCII 32 mapped to group element 2, and
so forth, with 126 mapped to group element 96.  For each character,
Alice generates a new ephemeral key pair.  The file ciphers.txt
contains a list of pairs of the ciphertext for a letter, and
Alice's ephemeral public key for that encryption.  For instance,
the first pair is (86, 63), where 86 is the encryption of some
letter, and 63 is Alice's ephemeral public key.

Decrypt the entire message and uncover the flag!
