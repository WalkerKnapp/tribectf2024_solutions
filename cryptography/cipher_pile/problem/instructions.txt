Cipher Pile

The courier for an important society accidentally left a pile of
encrypted documents (`a.enc`, `b.enc`, ..., `h.enc`) on a campus
bench, as well the plaintext (`plain`) for one of those encrypted
files.  A band of nine hungry squirrels has brought these files to
your desk.  To appease the squirrels, you must determine the society's
message that is embedded across the plaintext.
